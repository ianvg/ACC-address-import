Address import for Athens-Clarke County

This github project exists to suppor the Address import into OSM (OpenStreetMap) organized by me (user page: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:IanVG).

The import project page is on the OSM wiki here: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Address_Data_Import_for_Athens-Clarke_County.

I used the MergeAddressesAndBuildings .exe to further prepare the address import.

MergeAddressesAndBuildings /NewBuildings="C:\users\me\OSM\SouthCarolina.geojson" /NewAddresses="C:\users\me\OSM\NewAddresses.osm" /County="Spartanburg County" /State="SC" /ResultFolder="C:\users\me\OSM\Merged" /TaskManagerSize=2000
